It might happen due to not having rain or snow at that moment at all. However, this column doesn't bring much value for my dataset and will drop it. \n",

    "\n",
    "5. severerisk (Risk of Severe Weather Conditions): This column has 1374 missing values. Severerisk represents the risk level associated with severe weather conditions. The high count of missing values (1374) indicates that the risk level for severe weather was not applicable for these recordings, therefore NaN values as there was no risk level. In this situation, I will replace NaN values with 0 by using Imputation. \n",

The missing values suggest that the station identifiers are not added for these observations.
